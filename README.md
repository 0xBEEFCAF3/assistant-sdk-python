- USB audio adapter
- Microphone
- Speaker

API Setup
=========

- Visit [console.developers.google.com](console.developers.google.com).
- Select an existing project or create a new one.
- Go to `API Manager / Dashboard`.
- Enable `Google Cloud Speech API`.
- Go to `API Manager / Credentials`.
- Click `Create credentials / OAuth Client ID`.
- Select `Web`.
- Add `http://localhost:8080` and `http://raspberrypi.local:8080` as the `Authorized redirect URIs`.
- Click `Create`.
- Click `â¬‡` to download the `client_secret_XXXX.json` file.

Hardware setup
==============

- Connect the Microphone and the Speaker to the USB audio adapter.
- Connect the USB audio adapter to one of the Raspberry Pi USB port.
- Verify that the Microphone and the Speaker are working:

```
# record a short audio clip
arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16k --file-type=raw out.raw
# check recording by replaying it
aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16k out.raw
```

R Setup
==================

- Clone this repository:

```
git clone sso://devrel/samples/assistant/embedded-sdk-python embedded-assistant-sdk-python
```

- Copy the `client_secret_XXXX.json` file to the same directory:

```
cp ~/Downloads/client_secret_XXXX.json embedded-assistant-sdk-python/client_secret.json
```

- Copy this directory to the Raspberry Pi using `scp`:

```
scp -r embedded-assistant-sdk-python pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi
```

- SSH into the Raspberry Pi and install the sample dependencies:

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
cd embedded-assistant-sdk-python
python -m venv env
env/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the sample
==============

- Run the following command.
```
python embedded_assistant.py --client_secrets client_secret.json
```
- Follow the authorization instructions.
- Record your voice query and the sample should play back the assistant answer.
